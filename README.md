# Working with Skill Corner Tracking Data
This repository contains two .py files, skillcornerdatapreprocess - reads in a game at a time and outputs statistical summary of "quickness" for the players, and skillcornerplotter - which combines all the generated summary csv files and creates comparison bar plots for top 10 players in each category. 
All the generated summary csv files, images and the presentation in pdf and ppt format are included.
Requires installation of kloppy to work.
